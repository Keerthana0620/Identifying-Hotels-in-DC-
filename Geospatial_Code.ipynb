    "**Project Overview:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses geospatial analysis with Python, leveraging ArcPy, to identify ideal hotels near metro stations based on user preferences for travel distance, price, and rating, while also highlighting nearby landmarks for each hotel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users provide inputs such as their travel distance limit, the importance of price and ratings, and a selected metro station. The program processes geospatial data using Manhattan distance and raster analysis to filter hotels within the specified range. It then employs multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) to calculate scores to hotels based on user-defined priorities, ranking the top options.  It also identifies nearby landmarks for the recommended hotels, ensuring a comprehensive and user-friendly output.\n"
